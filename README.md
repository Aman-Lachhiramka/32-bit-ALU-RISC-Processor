# 32-bit-ALU-RISC-Processor
Course project for ECN-252 Digital Logic Design in 2nd year, IIT Roorkee in which we have implemented a 32 Bit ALU RISC processor. The processor is designed to perform arithmetic and logical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, AND, OR, XOR, etc on 32-bit data using the corresponding OP-Codes.
